# SmartDevice

Okay, I am back (23/12/2021) because I found this lovely package: [pychromecast](https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/pychromecast)




-----------------------------------------------------


This project is trying to make smart device smarter, however, sadly, I don't have the supported devices at this moment! @google

Supported Device:
- All Google Nest Thermostats
- All Google Nest Cameras
- All Google Nest Doorbells
- Google Nest Hub Max


**Conclusion: maybe impossible at this moment**


My Device:
- ~~Google Nest Hub~~
- ~~Google home mini~~
- ~~Light~~


## How to do?

[device-access](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/get-started#set_up_google_cloud_platform) should be the solution. 
The idea is to obtain the ultrasounds sensing information (0/1) and do the action based on that.

- [x] pay the 5$ registeration fee
- [ ] create an project and develop
