# SmartDevice

This project is trying to make smart device smarter, however, sadly, I don't have the supported devices at this moment! @google

Supported Device:
- All Google Nest Thermostats
- All Google Nest Cameras
- All Google Nest Doorbells
- Google Nest Hub Max


**Conclusion: impossible at this moment**


My Device:
- ~~Google Nest Hub~~
- ~~Google home mini~~
- ~~Light~~


## How to do?

[device-access](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/get-started#set_up_google_cloud_platform) should be the solution. 
The idea is to obtain the ultrasounds sensing information (0/1) and do the action based on that.
